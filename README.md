The Recipe Website is a dynamic and user-friendly platform designed to showcase a variety of recipes across different categories:
including Baking, Vegetarian Meals, Non-Vegetarian Meals, and Drinks.
Users can effortlessly explore recipes through an intuitive navigation bar, search for specific dishes using the homepage search functionality, and even contribute their own creations via a simple recipe submission form.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website provides a responsive design that ensures seamless performance across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Initial recipe data is stored in JSON, while JavaScript powers the interactive features, such as smooth scrolling and real-time search results.
With its visually appealing layout and robust features, this project serves as a comprehensive resource for food enthusiasts.
A key feature of this project is the use of a JSON file named recipes.json, which stores the initial recipe data. 
This JSON file is fetched and processed by JavaScript to dynamically render recipe content on the page.
The platform ensures seamless performance across devices with its responsive design.
With its visually appealing layout, robust interactivity, and the ability to expand the recipe database. 
This project serves as a comprehensive resource for food enthusiasts and aspiring chefs.
